            <p>Hello! I'm <b>Doan Anh Thy Bui</b>, I am currently a 1<sup>st</sup> year College student in Algonquin College. 
            My current program is <b>Interactive Media Design</b>, and Web Development 1 is one of the course in my program that I like. We are learning about 
            <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> at the beginning of this semester, and I found it very fun and interesting!
            The reason I chose this program because I am really interested in design and coding, so I transferred from my previous program to this program.
            </p>

            <p>I'm passionate about art, photograph, and psychology. Moreover, studying is one of my hobbies because I'm always strive to expand my knowledge 
                through continuous learning everyday. I will try hard more and dedicated to personal and professional growth in order to live my dream life in the future.
            </p>

            <p>This is one of the quotes that I really like: <br>
